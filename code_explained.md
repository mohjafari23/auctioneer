Here, we define the `AuctionItem` class, which represents an item in the auction. It has the following attributes:
- `name`: The name of the item.
- `picture`: The picture associated with the item.
- `start_price`: The starting price for the item.
- `highest_bidder`: The name of the highest bidder for the item.
- `highest_bid`: The highest bid amount for the item.

The `update_bid` method is used to update the highest bidder and bid amount for an item. It takes two parameters:
- `bidder`: The name of the bidder placing the bid.
- `bid_amount`: The bid amount placed by the bidder.

The method first checks if the bid amount is greater than or equal to the starting price (`bid_amount >= self.start_price`). It ensures that the bid is acceptable and meets or exceeds the minimum required bid. If the bid is valid, it then checks if the bid amount is greater than the current highest bid (`bid_amount > self.highest_bid`). If it is, the `highest_bidder` and `highest_bid` attributes are updated with the new bidder and bid amount.

```python
def auctioneer(items):
    print("Welcome to the Auctioneer Program!")
    print("-------------------------------")

    bidders = {}
    for item in items:
        bidders[item.name] = []

    while True:
        # ...

```

The `auctioneer` function handles the auction process. It takes a list of `AuctionItem` objects as input.

At the beginning, it initializes an empty dictionary, `bidders`, to keep track of the bidders for each item. The keys of the dictionary are the item names, and the values are empty lists. This dictionary will be used to ensure that a bidder can bid on an item only once.

```python
    while True:
        print("\nAvailable items for bidding:")
        for item in items:
            print(f"{item.name} - Picture: {item.picture} (Start Price: {item.start_price})")

        print("\nPlease select an item to bid on (or enter 'q' to quit):")
        item_name = input()

        if item_name == 'q':
            break

        if item_name not in bidders:
            print("Invalid item selection. Please try again.")
            continue

        print(f"\nBidding for item: {item_name}")
        bidder_name = input("Enter your name: ")
        bid_amount = int(input("Enter your bid amount: "))

        if bidder_name in bidders[item_name]:
            print("You have already bid on this item. Please try again.")
            continue

        if bid_amount < items[item_name].start_price:
            print("Bid amount is below the starting price. Please try again.")
            continue

        bidders[item_name].append(bidder_name)
        items[item_name].update_bid(bidder_name, bid_amount)

    # ...
```

Inside the `while` loop, the program displays the available items for bidding, including their names, pictures, and starting prices. It prompts the user to select an item by entering the item name,

 or enter 'q' to quit.

The program then checks if the entered item name is valid by verifying if it exists in the `bidders` dictionary. If it's not a valid item name, an error message is displayed, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

If the item name is valid, the program prompts the user to enter their name and the bid amount. It performs several checks:
- It verifies if the bidder has already bid on the selected item. If they have, an error message is displayed, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
- It checks if the bid amount is below the starting price of the item. If it is, an error message is displayed, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

If all the checks pass, the bidder's name is added to the list of bidders for the selected item (`bidders[item_name].append(bidder_name)`), and the `update_bid` method is called on the corresponding `AuctionItem` object to update the highest bidder and bid amount.

```python
    print("\nAuction Results:")
    for item in items:
        print(f"\nItem: {item.name}")
        if item.highest_bidder:
            print(f"Highest Bidder: {item.highest_bidder}")
            print(f"Highest Bid: {item.highest_bid}")
        else:
            print("No bids received for this item.")

    print("\nThank you for participating in the auction!")
```

After the user chooses to quit the auction by entering 'q', the program displays the auction results.

For each item, it prints the item name and checks if there is a highest bidder (`if item.highest_bidder`). If there is, it displays the highest bidder's name and the corresponding highest bid amount. If no bids were received for an item, it simply prints a message indicating that no bids were received.

Finally, a closing message is displayed to thank the participants for their participation in the auction.
